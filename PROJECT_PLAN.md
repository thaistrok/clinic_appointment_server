# Clinic Appointment System - Project Plan

## Overview

The Clinic Appointment System is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that enables patients and medical staff to securely register, authenticate, and manage medical appointments. The system features a responsive, user-friendly interface with role-based access control for patients, doctors, and administrators.

## Current System Status

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Frontend**: React.js (hosted separately)
- **Deployment**: Render (backend), Surge.sh (frontend)

### Core Features Implemented
1. User authentication and authorization
2. Role-based access control (patient, doctor, admin)
3. Appointment scheduling and management
4. Prescription creation and management
5. Medication database
6. User profile management
7. RESTful API design

### System Components

#### 1. User Management
- User registration and login
- Role-based permissions (patient, doctor, admin)
- Profile management
- Password security with bcrypt hashing

#### 2. Appointment Management
- Create, read, update, and delete appointments
- Doctor and patient appointment views
- Appointment status tracking (scheduled, confirmed, completed, cancelled)

#### 3. Prescription Management
- Create prescriptions linked to appointments
- Associate medications with prescriptions
- Doctor and patient prescription views

#### 4. Medication Database
- Store medication information
- Search and select medications for prescriptions

## Recent Improvements Made

### Security Enhancements
