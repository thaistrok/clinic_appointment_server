# Clinic Appointment System - Frontend

A modern React-based frontend application for a clinic appointment management system. This application allows patients and doctors to manage appointments, prescriptions, and user profiles through an intuitive user interface.

A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for a Clinic Appointment System. It enables users to securely register, authenticate, and explore pets available for adoption. The app features a responsive, mobile-first design with smooth animations to enhance user engagement. Users can browse adoptable pets, submit and manage adoption requests, add or edit pet listings, and update their user profiles. JWT-based authentication protects user-specific features, while MongoDB efficiently manages all CRUD operations for users, pets, and adoption requestsâ€”ensuring scalable, real-time performance across devices.
